*   üóìÔ∏è **Events Page:** Showcases upcoming university events, allowing users to discover, RSVP, and create events.

## Technology Stack

The application is built with a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack:

*   **Backend:** Python (with Django Framework)
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
*   **Database:** Well-structured DB Schema (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite)
*   **Design:** Figma

## Project Management

This project was managed using an **Agile/Scrum methodology**, organized into four distinct sprints. This allowed for iterative development, continuous feedback, and the flexibility to adapt to new requirements, ensuring the final product meets user needs.

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

A detailed Work Breakdown Structure was created to outline all deliverables and decompose the project into manageable work packages.

## Design & Development Process

### Design Phase (UX/UI)
Our design process was deeply rooted in user-centered principles to ensure an intuitive and effective user experience.

1.  **Research & Discovery:** We conducted user interviews with DePaul students and faculty to understand their networking needs and identify pain points, such as the lack of a streamlined platform.
2.  **User Personas:** We created empathy maps and detailed user personas (e.g., new students, faculty, alumni) to guide feature prioritization and define the core user experience.
3.  **Wireframing & Ideation:** We developed low-fidelity wireframes for key pages (Login, Profile, Feed, etc.) and iterated on layouts to ensure a smooth, consistent user flow across all devices.
4.  **Usability Testing & Prototyping:** We conducted usability tests on an interactive, high-fidelity prototype built in **Figma**. Feedback from these tests led to crucial adjustments in navigation, feed layout, and connection features.

### Development Approach
Our development philosophy prioritized clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
*   **User-Friendly and Responsive Design:** Ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **HTML Template Reuse:** Using Django's templating engine to create reusable components for consistency and faster development.
*   **Modular Backend Functions:** Writing small, easy-to-understand functions to improve maintainability and testing.
*   **Centralized CSS:** Organizing styles for consistency and easy updates.
*   **Well-Structured DB Schema:** Designing a logical and efficient database structure from the start.

## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, our team gained valuable insights that shaped our process and the final product:

1.  **User-Centered Design is Essential:** Early user research and empathy mapping were crucial for understanding user needs, leading to a more targeted and effective design.
2.  **Iterative Testing Drives Improvement:** Regular usability testing helped identify pain points, allowing for timely adjustments and ensuring a smoother user experience.
3.  **Effective Communication Streamlines Development:** Clear communication between design, development, and testing teams minimized misunderstandings, keeping the project on track.
4.  **Prioritizing Features Reduces Scope Creep:** Focusing on MVP features kept the project manageable, preventing delays and helping us stay within budget.
5.  **Agile Adaptability Enhances Product Quality:** Flexibility in adjusting the design and functionality based on feedback resulted in a more refined and user-friendly final product.
